    "# Overview\n",
    "Welcome to the new way to load data! We have created this notebook so that you can select what type of data you want and then load that data without having to figure out how. You don't need to know where the data is coming from or how to extract it - just pick the specifications you want for the data, run the program, and you will get a dataset returned that you can interact with. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What to expect in each section\n",
    "### Data specification exploration\n",
    "In this section, you will be able to see what types of data specifications you might want to select. For example, we'll show you some of the options for the activities, and you can simply select which activities you are interested in seeing. These come from the Amazon Sustanability Data Initiative, or [ASDI](https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/environment/the-cloud/amazon-sustainability-data-initiative) if you want to reference or learn more about the data specifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting the data set\n",
    "Now that you have selected the various data sets, you can simply run the cell to get the data set. Behind the scenes, this dynamically determines where the data is stored, how to extract it, and does so in just a few minutes! Feel free to grab a coffee while you wait for it to run. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Data exploration and analysis\n",
    "Now that you have the data, you can use this section of the notebook to run experiments on the data, plot it, create hypotheses, and eventually publish your data. If you decide you want to examine a different data set, you can start again at the beginning and keep all of the code youve written here to analyze the new returned data set. "
